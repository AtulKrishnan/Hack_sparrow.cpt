Revamp of Mobile User Interface 

We all have old people at home. And we all know that many of them struggle to get adjusted to today's technology.
We have designed a prototype using Adobe XD for creating a mobile user interface that is more senior citizen friendly. 
We have incorporated bigger fonts and more senior citizen friendly icons like a hand mic for voice controls over the icon that is currently being used.
Our idea is to make it like a mode. Like for example there is a dark mode. Like that we want to make a senior mode option. And collaborate with the major apps that senior citizens are fond off, like whatsapp, youtube among others.

The Adobe XD code is there in the two Google Pixel files that have been committed to this repository along with the various pictures we have used.
The Senior Modeeee file contains the prototype that we have developed and can be opened on Adobe XD.

We hope you guys like our idea!
